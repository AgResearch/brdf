				Two additional nematode genomes are now in the sequencing 
				pipeline. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, an entomopathogenic 
				nematode used in insect control, has been approved for 
				sequencing by NHGRI but not yet assigned to a sequencing center. 
				Haemonchus contortus, an economically important sheep and goat 
				nematode parasite, is currently being sequenced at the Wellcome 
				Trust Sanger Institute. These additions will bring the total 
				number of sequenced nematode genomes to ten in the near future.
